        <h2>About Bekal Fort, Bekal</h2>
        <p>Built almost 300 years ago, Bekal Fort is considered as one of the largest and most preserved forts in Kerala. Nestled in the lap of nature, Bekal Fort is a historic fort surrounded by a beautiful beach offering an enchanting view of Arabian Sea from its high observation tower where once the cannons were placed. The beautiful walkway, illuminated beach and the grand architecture of the Bekal Fort make this place a favourite among the masses. The fort was featured in the popular A R Rahman song ' Tu hi re'.

            Located at 65 kms away from Mangalore, Bekal Fort is a keyhole-shaped lofty structure that stands still against the rocky shores of sea amusing its visitors with its finesse. The whole purpose of erecting this structure by Shivappa Nayaka of Bednore in the year 1650 was pure of defence.
