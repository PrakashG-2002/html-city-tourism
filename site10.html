        <h2>About Bolgatty Palace, Kochi</h2>
        <p>Bolgatty Palace is located in Bolgatty Island of Kochi and is one of the oldest existing Dutch palaces that is situated outside Holland. It is an exquisite example of the Kochi style of architecture. Built-in 1744 by Dutch traders, it was later extended, and gardens were landscaped around it. Green gardens, azure skies and the virgin charms of Kerela are aplenty at the Bolgatty Palace.

            Owing to its picturesque surroundings and rich history, the building has also served as the Governor's palace for the commander of Dutch Malabar and was the home of the British. Today, it has re-established itself as a luxury hotel and is a favourite among couples. True to its name, the Bolgatty Palace is palatial in every sense of the word. The edifice is surrounded by carefully manicured gardens that make for a delightful spot for an evening walk. Inside, the palace is divided into three distinct sections, the Main Block, the Marina Block and the Mansion Block.</p>
